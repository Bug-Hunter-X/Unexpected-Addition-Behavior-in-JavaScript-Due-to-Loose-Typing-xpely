This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by the language's loose typing system. The bug occurs when performing arithmetic operations with variables of different data types, leading to unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code that shows the unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that uses type checking to mitigate this issue.
